# 🛒 E-Commerce Analytics Engineering Project

An end-to-end Analytics Engineering project built with **dbt + Snowflake** on the 
Brazilian E-Commerce dataset (Olist) — 100k+ real orders across 9 source tables.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

A mid-size e-commerce company has raw transactional data scattered across multiple 
source systems. Business teams can't answer critical questions like:
- Which customers are at risk of churning?
- What is our monthly revenue trend?
- Which products drive 80% of sales?

This project builds a clean, tested, and documented data model that analysts can 
trust and query directly — without touching raw data.

## 🏗️ Architecture


Raw CSV Sources (9 tables)
↓
Bronze Layer  →  Raw data loaded into Snowflake as-is
↓
Silver Layer  →  Cleaned, typed, deduplicated (dbt views)
↓
Gold Layer    →  Star schema: fact + dimensions (dbt tables)
↓
dbt Tests + Docs + Lineage

| `stg_order_items` | Line items with price and freight |
| `stg_order_payments` | Payment type and value per order |
| `stg_order_reviews` | Review scores and comments |
| `stg_products` | Product dimensions and category |
| `stg_sellers` | Seller location data |

## ✅ Data Quality

- **26 dbt tests** across all models
- Tests include: `unique`, `not_null`, `accepted_values`, `relationships`
- Review scores validated to accepted range [1–5]
- All primary keys tested for uniqueness and nullability
